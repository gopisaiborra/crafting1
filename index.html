                        For leather bags or bags with leather features: Skip the soapy brush and instead apply leather conditioner to the spot with a soft cloth. Buff the leather until it shines.[7]

Store your tote bag in a dust bag when you arenâ€™t using it. Most Marc Jacobs backpacks, purses, and bags come with a dust bag so you can keep your bag clean when not in use. Keep your tote bag stuffed with tissue paper and store it in a room-temperature place away from direct sunlight or excessive moisture.[10]
Marc Jacobs also has a 1-year Bags and Leather Goods Warranty. Contact the store where you purchased the bag for warranty information.</span></td>

        Deep clean your bag every 6 months. To keep your tote bag looking great, aim to deep clean it about every 6 months and spot-clean as needed. If you use your bag every day, consider cleaning it a little more often (about every 3 months).
        To keep your bag clean, avoid setting it on the ground, where it might be more likely to get stained.
        Unless the care label says to, always hand wash your bag and avoid putting it in the washing machine to prevent it from becoming damaged.

Now fold in the left bottom corner in the same way, so that its edge meets the edge of the other side at the center, creating an upside-down kite shape.</span></td>

            Apply a water-resistant spray to protect your bag from staining. To protect your bag from hard-to-clean stains and water damage in the future, apply a water-resistant spray to the inside and outside of the bag. Reapply the spray after each wash.[12]
            Some recommend using Scotchguard Fabric Protector, a specific brand of stain and water-repellent spray.</span></td>
